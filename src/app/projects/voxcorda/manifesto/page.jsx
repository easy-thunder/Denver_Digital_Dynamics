        <h2>The Nuance of America’s Largest Problems</h2>

        <h3>How We All Contribute To Moving The Goal Post For Success</h3>
        <p>
          An economy grows in three primary ways: first, by increasing the number of people who
          work, for example through population growth, immigration, or policies that raise
          labor-force participation; second, by innovating how work is done through better
          processes and technology, for example building trading systems and marketplaces that
          match buyers and sellers more efficiently, improving logistics and management methods,
          and using software to automate routine tasks; third, by inventing new products and
          services, for example the smartphone, new medicines, or new materials that open entirely
          new markets.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many ways to grow wealth. One common path is leverage: organizing other people’s
          work to build a valuable product, whether through direct business ownership or by owning
          shares in a company. This can be positive when a firm creates real value that society finds
          useful. It becomes incidious when returns come mainly from squeezing costs and raising
          prices without adding value. Examples include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Outsourcing to low-standard jurisdictions. </strong>
            &nbsp;Moving production to places with cheaper labor and weaker environmental safeguards
            to cut costs while shifting social and ecological risks onto others. The result is
            layoffs and reduced wages so companies can compete with one another on their pricing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shrinkflation.</strong>
            &nbsp;Just when you discovered you were going to make less(or get laid off), you find
            out that you're money is also buying less.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data-driven price discrimination and Predatory pricing.</strong>
            &nbsp;On the surface it seems kinda nice that poor people pay less for their goods and
            services. However, this aids in selling below cost to push rivals out, followed by price
            hikes once competition weakens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Worker misclassification.</strong>
            &nbsp; You get hurt on the job, but guess what, you work as a contractor and you get
            no benefit payout. No workmans comp. No healthcare.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consolidation to blunt competition.</strong>
            &nbsp;Asset managers or large firms buying competitors or controlling distribution to
            limit lower-price options.
            &nbsp;<a href="/learn/asset-management">How asset management companies manufacture monopoly</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We all play a role in these outcomes. Every purchase and investment is a signal. When we
          support companies that rely on extractive tactics, we reinforce those tactics. When we
          favor firms that compete on quality, fair treatment, and transparency, we help shift
          incentives toward healthier forms of wealth creation. Accountability starts with our own
          choices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately the advocacy to just invest and buy fairly and equitably is not new. Since
          the rise of Walmart, many of us have prioritized the lowest price over fair wages. Low pay
          increases pressure for cheaper goods, and the pursuit of cheaper goods then reinforces the
          very practices that keep wages low. Furthermore, our push to enrich ourselves through the
          stock market can compound the cycle, as we reward firms for higher margins achieved by
          offshoring production or holding down pay at home. In many ways the stock market has
          robbed the working man his wages; and as more people invest into this system the further
          the goal post for success moves for those that exist outside of the trading system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another path to wealth is asset ownership. At its best, ownership creates value when
          owners add supply, improve quality, and maintain what they hold. It turns harmful when
          returns depend on engineered scarcity, regulatory choke points, or control of essentials.
          Just when you thought it can't get any worse for a young worker Consider:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            &nbsp; Acquiring land and waiting for permits or upzoning that funds future development,
            yet lobbying for restrictive rules that block new entrants can inflate values without
            adding homes.
          </li>
          <li>
            &nbsp;Buying large numbers of homes to convert to rentals or hold off-market can
            stabilize income for the owner, yet it can also reduce local supply and push up prices
            and rents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Natural resources and water rights.</strong>
            &nbsp;Investment can boost productivity and conservation. Hoarding or over-extraction
            can raise costs for communities and degrade ecosystems.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Advocates have discussed these issues for years to deaf ears and <strong>bought</strong>{' '}
          politicians. These patterns move the goal post for success farther away. When ownership
          strategies restrict supply and cut labor costs, basic security requires more income, and
          the gains flow to a narrow few. The gap between honest effort and attainable outcomes
          widens, so people conclude that the game is rigged. The anger is understandable when no
          change has happened with advocacy to form governance for these issues. It’s no wonder that
          so many cheer when a billionaire is killed.
        </p>

        <h3>Political Rhetoric, Shadow Government, and Social Media</h3>
        <p>
          For the last ten years the political rhetoric has been immigration, LGBTQ rights, and
          abortion. The same three topics are fought over year after year while ignoring all of these
          other issues. I’m not saying these issues are meaningless, but rather these arguments are
          used as a distraction. Bipartisan issues such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Banning lawmakers from trading individual stocks.</li>
          <li>Prohibiting excessive price increases during emergencies.</li>
          <li>Requiring financial literacy education in public high schools.</li>
          <li>Restricting corporate spending in elections</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Common-sense, bipartisan steps should be easy wins, yet they rarely advance because
          political self-interest combined with distraction which swamps the conversation; furthermore,
          social media amplifies polarizing rhetoric that steers our attention. History shows how
          public discourse can be shaped by powerful institutions: the FBI’s{' '}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            COINTELPRO
          </a>{' '}
          program, active from 1956 to 1971, surveilled, infiltrated, discredited, and disrupted
          groups across the political spectrum, including civil-rights leaders, using tactics like
          smear campaigns, forged documents, and illegal surveillance. While that program ended, its
          legacy makes it plausible that today’s debates can be engineered indirectly by platform
          algorithms and by actors who benefit from outrage over solutions. The result is a public
          square that keeps skipping past practical reforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have fallen victim to this polarization and have been caught in the rhetorical loop. I
          fall for my own social media algorithm and I believe that my anti-ICE feed has tainted my
          view of the right. Many people on the right simply believe that immigration is a problem
          that de-values their work. There really isn't anything wrong with this view point. I
          started realizing this when I found out that under Obama’s administration he had deported
          more immigrants in a year then what ICE is projected to do in 2025. But I don't agree with
          how we are executing the solution to this issue. That is where a direct democracy can help
          us find more agreeable solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>Voxcorda: Direct, Delegable Democracy</h3>

        <p>
          The deeper problem is trust. Many of us believe that rules are written by donors, that
          lawmakers trade on information the public does not have, and that lobbyists shape what gets
          a hearing. Add the well-documented history of domestic surveillance by federal agencies,
          and a daily diet of algorithmic feeds that reward outrage over solutions, and it is no
          surprise that faith in institutions is thin. People feel like their voice is not heard and
          nobody really knows if this is actually what we the people voted for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Voxcorda’s direct liquid democracy is built to repair that trust. It gives each person a
          direct vote on issues and a separate vote on solutions, with the option to delegate by
          topic to someone they choose. Delegations are public, revocable at any time, and scoped to
          a domain, so expertise can travel without surrendering control. Ballots include short
          evidence packs for and against, timelines, budgets, and success metrics, so the
          conversation shifts from identity to tradeoffs. Counting is transparent, results are
          auditable, and every decision leaves a public record of who argued what, who voted how, and
          what happened afterward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Applying this system to the example I provided on immigration we the people get to decide
          if immigration is an issue that needs to be addressed. And we the people are given the
          opportunity for all of our voices to be heard to ascertain what the best solution is to
          immigration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Voxcorda's goal is not to punish success. It is to move the goal post back within reach by
          replacing distraction with decisions and replacing opaque power with accountable mandates.
          When communities, residents, workers, and customers can vote or delegate by topic,
          businesses become more democratic, policies match real needs, and extractive shortcuts lose
          their appeal. Voxcorda is a practical way to convert frustration into outcomes: decide
          together, publish the results, and deliver on what people actually chose.
